<h1>Concurrency Groups</h1>

      Overview

      <p>
FASTBuild automatically utilizes available CPU cores and parallelizes
work where possible given the constraints of dependencies between tasks.
While global concurrency can be controlled with the
<a href="../options.html#jx">-j</a> option, in some cases more
fine-grained control is useful or desirable.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Linkers</b> - Some linkers with certain codebases or options
  can use very large amounts of memory such that system memory may be
  exhausted when multiple link operations occur in parallel.</li>
  <li><b>Tests</b> - Running tests may rely on exclusive access to
  resources, such as network sockets, development hardware or file
  system structures. Running such tests concurrently may cause failures.</li>
  <li><b>Compilers</b> - Some compilers with certain codebases or options
  may use very large amounts of memory, exhausting system memory if run
  concurrently. Special options such as Static Analysis can often
  significantly increase memory usage.</li>
  <li><b>Old Toolchains</b> - Some toolchains may not be possible to run
  concurrently due to assumptions about being run in a single threaded
  environment.</li>
  <li><b>External Processes</b> - Invocation of external processes or
  scripts may not suppport being run concurrently.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above cases, limiting concurrency between related tasks can be
useful while still allowing other tasks to be scheduled in an unconstrained
manner. Concurrency Groups allow such tasks to be constrained.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Concurrency Groups by their very nature limit build parallelism.
Additionally, each Concurrency Group adds a small overhead to all job
scheduling. As such, Concurrency Groups should be used sparingly and as few
groups as possible should be used.</p>
</div>

    <div id='alias' class='newsitemheader'>Defining Concurrency Groups</div>
    <div class='newsitembody'>
<p>Concurrency Groups are named objects, specified globally via the <a href="../functions/settings.html">Settings</a> function. Each group is later referenced in tasks that should be in said group via .ConcurrencyGroupName.</p>
<p>
<b>Concurrency Limit</b>
<p>A Concurrency Group can define a .ConcurrencyLimit in order to cap the
number of tasks in the group that can be run in parallel. For example,
to limit concurrency to a single task:</p>
<div class='code'>Settings
{
    .Group =
    [
        .ConcurrencyGroupName   = 'TestExecution'
        .ConcurrencyLimit       = 1
    ]
    .ConcurrencyGroups = { .Group }
}
</div>

<b>Concurrency Job Memory Limit</b><br>
<p>A Concurrency Group can define a .ConcurrencyPerJobMiB value in order to
cap the number of tasks in the group based on the physical memory of the host.
For example to limit concurrency assuming 2GiB per-task is required:</p>
<div class='code'>Settings
{
    .Group =
    [
        .ConcurrencyGroupName   = 'Linker'
        .ConcurrencyPerJobMiB   = 2048
    ]
    .ConcurrencyGroups = { .Group }
}
</div>
<p>This constraint can be useful when dealing with tasks that need to run
on a variety of systems which may have differening capabilities such that
a fixed limit would unnecssarily pessimize for some users.</p>

<b>Multiple Constraints</b><br>
</p>Concurrency constraints can be combined, limiting by both absolute
count as well as memory requirements as in the following example:</p>
<div class='code'>Settings
{
    .Group =
    [
        .ConcurrencyGroupName   = 'Example'
        .ConcurrencyLimit       = 4
        .ConcurrencyPerJobMiB   = 2048
    ]
    .ConcurrencyGroups = { .Group }
}
</div>
<p>The lesser of the two constraints at any given time will be utilized to
limit concurrency appropriately.</p>
</div>

    <div id='alias' class='newsitemheader'>Using Concurrency Groups</div>
    <div class='newsitembody'>
<p>Tasks which support Concurrency Groups expose a .ConcurrencyGroupName
property which can be set to reference a previously defined Concurrency
Group. For example:</p>
   <div class='code'>Test( 'Test-Run-$Config$' )
{
    .ConcurrencyGroupName   = 'TestExecution'
</div>
<p>Tasks withing a given group will respect the concurrency constraits
of that group.</p>
