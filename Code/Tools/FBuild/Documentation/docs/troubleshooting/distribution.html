<div id='brokerage' class='newsitemheader'>Worker Discovery / Brokerage</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <h4>1. Confirm FASTBUILD_BROKERAGE_PATH is Set</h4>
     <p>Make sure the brokerage path environment variable (FASTBUILD_BROKERAGE_PATH) is set on the Client 
     (machine initiating the build) and the Server(s) (machines running the FBuildWorker).<p/>
     <p>You may need to reboot/logout to propagate new Environment Variables.</p>
  <h4>2. Confirm Brokerage Read/Write Access</h4>
     <p>Make sure your brokerage path can be accessed from both the Client and Server(s).  Viewing the path
     through Windows Explorer/Finder/etc is usually sufficient to ensure the path is correct and permissions
     don't prevent read access.</p>
     <p>Try creating a file in this directory to ensure write permissions are
     granted.</p>
  <h4>3. Verify the brokerage structure</h4>
     <p>With at least one worker running, a directory strucure should be created in your brokerage path:
     <div class='output'>\\server-pc\.fastbuild.brokerage\main\%version%</div>
     where %version% is the current distributed protocol version.</p>
     <p>If this folder structure is missing, check for write permissions.</p>
</div>

<div id='availability' class='newsitemheader'>Worker Availability</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <h4>1. Ensure Worker(s) are Available</h4>
     <p>Check the UI of your worker(s) to ensure they show some CPUs as "Idle" (and therefore available for use).</p>
     <p><div align="center"><img src='../img/worker_available.png' /></div></p>
     <p>It your worker PC has other applications constantly consuming non-trivial amounts of CPU time (>10%), the
     worker may never become available.</p>
     <p>To force a worker to be available, ignoring local CPU usage of other processes, you can set the 
     "Current Mode" to "Work For Others Always":</p>
     <p><div align="center"><img src='../img/worker_available_always.png' /></div></p>
  <h4>2. Check Worker is Available in Brokerage</h4>
     <p>When a worker is available, it will create a token in the brokerage structure:
     <div class='output'>\\server-pc\.fastbuild.brokerage\main\%version%\%hostname%</div>
     where %version% is the current distributed protocol version and %hostname% is the name
     of the worker PC.</p>
     <p>If this token is missing, check for write permissions.</p>
</div>

<div id='activation' class='newsitemheader'>Distribution Activated</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <h4>1. Ensure Distribution is Activated</h4>
    <p>Distributed compilation must be activated on the command line with -dist.</p>
</div>

<div id='discovery' class='newsitemheader'>Worker Discovery</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <h4>1. Ensure Client is finding Workers</h4>
    <p>When the build starts, you should see some output in the console:</p>
    <p><div class='output'>Distributed Compilation : 1 Workers in pool</div></p>
    <p>This confirms that the distributed build is discovering the workers.</p>
  <h4>2. Ensure Connection to Workers</h4>
    <p>Shortly after a distributed build starts, FASTBuild will start connecting
       to the available FBuildWorkers. Verify that your workers are being connected to by
       checking the UI. (If you are troubleshooting, you may like to limit your
       setup to one worker so you can control which workers will be used.)</p>
       <p><div align="center"><img src='../img/worker_connection.png' /></div></p>
       <p>Failure to establish any connections could indicate a routing or firewall problem
       on your network.</p>
    </p>
</div>


<div id='compatibility' class='newsitemheader'>Compatible Compiler &amp; Options</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <h4>1. Ensure Compatible Compiler</h4>
      <p>Make sure the compiler being used is compatible with network distribution,
         as described <a href="../features/distribution.html">here</a>.</p>
  <h4>2. Compiler() Setup</h4>
      <p>Ensure your compiler is configured using the <a href="../functions/compiler.html">Compiler()</a>
        function in the BFF config. If you are using a compiler (such as MSVC) that requires additional
         DLLs, be sure to configure those as well (see <a href="../functions/compiler.html">Compiler()</a>
         for more details).</p>
  <h4>3. Ensure Compatible Compatible Options</h4> 
      <p>Some compiler options prevent distribution as described 
         <a href="../features/distribution.html">here</a>. Use -showcmds to ensure none
         of those options are on your command line.</p> 
</div>
  
<div id='results' class='newsitemheader'>Results</div>
<div class='newsitembody'>
  <p>If everything is working, you should see output similar to the following for any distributed tasks:</p>
  <div class='output'>-> Obj: C:\Test\tmp\x86-Profile\TestFramework\Unity1.obj &lt;REMOTE: 192.168.0.8&gt;
-> Obj: C:\Test\tmp\x86-Debug\TestFramework\Unity1.obj &lt;REMOTE: 192.168.0.8&gt;
-> Obj: C:\Test\tmp\x86Clang-Debug\CoreTest\Unity1.obj &lt;REMOTE: 192.168.0.8&gt;</div>
